Step 2: Agents in a Workflow non-streaming

This sample uses two custom executors. A Writer agent creates or edits content,
then hands the conversation to a Reviewer agent which evaluates and finalizes the result.

Purpose:
Show how to wrap chat agents created by AzureOpenAIChatClient inside workflow executors. Demonstrate how agents
automatically yield outputs when they complete, removing the need for explicit completion events.
The workflow completes when it becomes idle.

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient with required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, executors, edges, events, and streaming or non streaming runs.
