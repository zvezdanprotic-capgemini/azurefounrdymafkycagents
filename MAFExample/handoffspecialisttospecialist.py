"""Sample: Multi-tier handoff workflow with specialist-to-specialist routing.

This sample demonstrates advanced handoff routing where specialist agents can hand off
to other specialists, enabling complex multi-tier workflows. Unlike the simple handoff
pattern (see handoff_simple.py), specialists here can delegate to other specialists
without returning control to the user until the specialist chain completes.

Routing Pattern:
    User → Triage → Specialist A → Specialist B → Back to User

This pattern is useful for complex support scenarios where different specialists need
to collaborate or escalate to each other before returning to the user. For example:
    - Replacement agent needs shipping info → hands off to delivery agent
    - Technical support needs billing info → hands off to billing agent
    - Level 1 support escalates to Level 2 → hands off to escalation agent

Configuration uses `.add_handoff()` to explicitly define the routing graph.

Prerequisites:
    - `az login` (Azure CLI authentication)
    - Environment variables configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient
