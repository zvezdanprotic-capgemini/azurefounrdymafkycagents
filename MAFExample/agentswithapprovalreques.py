Sample: Agents in a workflow with AI functions requiring approval

This sample creates a workflow that automatically replies to incoming emails.
If historical email data is needed, it uses an AI function to read the data,
which requires human approval before execution.

This sample works as follows:
1. An incoming email is received by the workflow.
2. The EmailPreprocessor executor preprocesses the email, adding special notes if the sender is important.
3. The preprocessed email is sent to the Email Writer agent, which generates a response.
4. If the agent needs to read historical email data, it calls the read_historical_email_data AI function,
   which triggers an approval request.
5. The sample automatically approves the request for demonstration purposes.
6. Once approved, the AI function executes and returns the historical email data to the agent.
7. The agent uses the historical data to compose a comprehensive email response.
8. The response is sent to the conclude_workflow_executor, which yields the final response.

Purpose:
Show how to integrate AI functions with approval requests into a workflow.

Demonstrate:
- Creating AI functions that require approval before execution.
- Building a workflow that includes an agent and executors.
- Handling approval requests during workflow execution.

Prerequisites:
- Azure AI Agent Service configured, along with the required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, edges, events, RequestInfoEvent, and streaming runs.

        - **Bug Bash and Code Freeze:**
            - We recently completed a bug bash, during which several issues were identified. Alice and Charlie are working on fixing these critical bugs, and we anticipate resolving them by the end of this week.
            - We have entered a code freeze as of November 4, 2025.

        - **Requirements Update:**
            - Bob has updated the requirements for a new feature, and all team members are reviewing these changes to ensure alignment.

        - **Ongoing Reviews:**
            - Charlie has submitted his latest code changes for review to ensure they meet our quality standards.

        Please let me know if you need more detailed information or have any questions.

        Best regards,
        John"
