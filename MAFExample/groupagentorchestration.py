Sample: Group Chat with Agent-Based Manager

What it does:
- Demonstrates the new set_manager() API for agent-based coordination
- Manager is a full ChatAgent with access to tools, context, and observability
- Coordinates a researcher and writer agent to solve tasks collaboratively

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI environment variables configured for OpenAIChatClient

You coordinate a team conversation to solve the user's task.

Review the conversation history and select the next participant to speak.

Guidelines:
- Start with Researcher to gather information
- Then have Writer synthesize the final answer
- Only finish after both have contributed meaningfully
- Allow for multiple rounds of information gathering if needed
